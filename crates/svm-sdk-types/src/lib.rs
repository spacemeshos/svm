#![no_std]
#![feature(maybe_uninit_uninit_array)]

//! This crate implements SDK types or SVM.
//! Using this crate when writing SVM Templates in Rust isn't mandatory but should be very useful.
//!
//! The crate is compiled with `![no_std]` (no Rust stdlib) annotation in order to reduce the compiled WASM size.
