# SVM Introduction

## Motivation

The SVM component exists to serve as the transaction executor.
Each transaction selected to execute by the Full-Node is passed to SVM that runs it and returns a receipt as a result.
In addition to running transactions, SVM exposes a validation interface. Thus, before running a transaction, we need to make sure that it's syntactically valid.

The other primary role of SVM is owning the so-called `Global-State`

The `Global-State` is a fancy name for `The Bank of All System Accounts`(More information later under the `Global State` section).
When a transaction runs, it runs on-behalf of an Account (this is not precisely always the case - see `Transactions Types` later).

The transaction running code will run and possibly create changes to the executing Account.
In other words, running a transaction isn't a stateless process. One of the implications is that the order of running transactions matters.
Each transaction will start running given a contextual `State` and finish with a new `State`.

Sometimes the ending `State` will be the same as the starting one. For example, it might be due to running code that didn't modify any account in the system.
Other times, the transaction didn't have enough gas to execute fully, and any uncommitted changes will be discarded.
The `State` of the system will remain the same, and the Account sending the transaction (the principal) will have to pay for the failed running.

## High-level Description

- **Runtime**
  The Runtime is the piece that orchestrates both validation and execution of transactions.
  It integrates with a Wasm Runtime (we currently use [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/)) and makes sure each running transaction returns a receipt.
- **Accounts**
  In a very similar way to bank accounts in real life, in SVM, there're more general accounts.
  An account is very similar to an actor under the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) design or an object in Object-Oriented languages.

Each Account essentially has its code and its internal data - we'll refer to it as its storage.
Two different accounts can hold the same code, but each will have its private storage.

- **Templates**
  To encourage code reuse and saving of used disk space, SVM introduced the notion of a Template.
  A Template is a recipe from which accounts are spawned. Each `Template` might be used to spawn many accounts.
  Each spawned Account will be attached to the same Template, but the code will be stored only once.
- **Transactions Types**
  The SVM comes with three types of transactions:

- **Deploy**
  To leverage a Template, we first need to make sure it's deployed.
  Each Template has a unique `Template Address` assigned to it.

For the 1st Mainnet - each Template deployment will take place as part of the Genesis flow.

- **Spawn**
  Once we've got a deployed `Template`, we can start to exploit it and spawn many accounts of it.
  As part of running a `Spawn` transaction, the new Account gets to execute a constructor function.
  Running constructors will be (mostly) used for initializing the new account storage.

- **Call**
  After we've spawned a new account, we can start using it. That's the job of the `Call` transaction.
  The `Call` transaction is by far the most used transaction type on the system since spawning accounts occur much less often.

- **Codec**
  The `Codec` is responsible for encoding & decoding transactions and receipts.
  Its code is shipped on two platforms. One is SVM, and the other is a Wasm package to be used by clients such as `smapp`
  The reason for shipping the `Codec` in its Wasm form is that clients will be able to craft transactions before dispatching them to the network.
  Additionally, clients and others (the Process Explorer) would like to decode historical transactions and receipts.
  They can use the `Codec` Wasm package for doing that.

- **Global-State**
  The Global-State is in charge of all accounts. Therefore, it can do the basics such as creating accounts or transferring coins between accounts, but it always operates in the context of a given State.
  The Global-State may be requested to rewind to a historical `State`.
  Each running accumulates dirty changes that will be persisted on the next commit. As long as changes have not been committed, the Global-State can be asked to drop them.
  It's done when a transaction fails (panics or reaches Out-Of-Gas) - in that case; the Global-State will discard its dirty changes.

- **SDK**
  The SDK of the SVM project exists to assist with developing Templates in Rust.
  In theory, Templates can be manually created by writing Wasm, but it's not a feasible solution.
  The other alternative is writing code in a high-level language that compiles to Wasm, but doing that without some SDK will be unwieldy.
  Besides making lives more manageable for the developer of a Template, the SDK's job is to make sure that the emitted Wasm code adheres to the restrictions of a Fixed-Gas Wasm.
- **Fixed-Gas**

  Each transaction becoming part of the Mesh needs to pay gas for its execution.
  The problem is that we don't have any good answer to the question "How much gas will this transaction require?".
  The reason for that is rooted in the [Halting Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). Given a program, we can't know whether or not it will ever halt.
  The implication is that SVM can't execute a single transaction without setting a gas limit for running a transaction.

The Fixed-Gas solution tries to find a sweet point between a good gas estimation usage experience and what a running program can achieve while running.
The solution is that if a program has no loops - we can give a gas estimation that will guarantee we won't hit Out-Of-Gas.
Loops must not exist in any formâ€”neither explicit Wasm loop nor recursions nor cyclic calls between functions.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7Na1Kf21A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7Na1Kf21A)

At this point, SVM doesn't support Gas-Metering for Wasm programs having loops. As a result, such programs will fail validations today for not being Fixed-Gas compliant.

- **FFI**
  SVM ships with an FFI layer to be used by non-Rust code.
  Since the Node hosting SVM is written in Golang (see: [https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh)), the FFI layer is essential.

Golang has the `cgo` package that makes calling C code possible.
To make life easier for the `go-spacemesh` project, we've created a library called `go-svm`(link: [https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-svm](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-svm))
that does the heavy lifting of using `cgo` against the SVM objects files. The end-user of `go-svm` should enjoy an excellent ergonomic Golang API.

## Guidelines

- **Fast**
  It's crucial that SVM will execute as fast as we can.
  Besides being written in Rust, the Singlepass compiler will be used (Windows solutions is upcoming on Wasmer's next release).

- **Secure**
  The transactions are running in a sandboxed environment (it's one of Wasm's most significant strengths).
  Besides that, using the Singlepass solution guarantees a linear-time compilation and defense against JIT Bombs.

- **Portable**
  Since Spacemesh Full-Node is targeted for the mass, it must work on any of the three popular Operating-Systems: macOS, Linux, and Windows.
